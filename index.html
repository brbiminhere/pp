        <p>Let me guess, some man lost a condescending bet of some sort and someone suggested they should go through this programme, one bet at a time.</p>
        <h3>You're in the right place!</h3>
        <p>Granted you can win, they'll soon get what's coming for them and you'll have tons of fun in the process of training your own little pet to perfection, until they graduate from Pet University.</p>
        <p> <em> However, if you want to make sure your pet won't back out... follow this <a href="tip.html">tip</a>.</em></p>
        <p> Remember, however, that anytime your pet wins a bet they go back a step in this programme! </p>
