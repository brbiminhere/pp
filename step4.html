    <center><h1>Step 4 - Pit Stop </h1>
        <p>By now, you should be used to your pet looking up to you in defeat with your foot well put on their face. It's nothing new, really. </p>
        <p>So, this is a stop for your pet to take a break. Nothing happens at this step, keep having fun with what authority you currently do have: remind them of their place.</p>
        <p>Note that your pet's will should almost be broken now, and there is hardly turning back at this point - someone is obeying you like a complete slave.</p>
