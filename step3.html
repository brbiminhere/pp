        <p>Three bets in a row isn't looking good for your pet - they've had their chance, but now it's time to pay up. Level 3 is especially a good one if they just lost a sports bet. </p>
        <p>Put their face where it should be - pressed under the bottom of your feet, and make sure to take nice pictures of them as they train so hard at Pet University.</p>

      <p>If they wanna keep risking it, don't stop them, it's all in good fun.</p>
