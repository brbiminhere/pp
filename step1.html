    <center><h1>Step 1 - Sorting Out Names </h1>
        <p>Obviously, a name won't be of much use, and it's the first thing we get rid of. Your pet may only refer to you as Owner. </p>
        <p>As for them, you can call them anything you like: pet, servant, slave, whatever is funniest or you fancy the most, will now be their full and only name.</p>
        <p> That's it. First bet won't get you much, and it's only fair: but if they keep losing, they're in trouble. </p>
