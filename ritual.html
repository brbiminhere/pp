        <p>This is the ritual.</p>
        <p>As soon as your pet gets to Step 1, you should get them started on this.</p>
        <p>It is an extremely important piece of this programme, because it is vital to getting to break your pet. </p>
        <p>Everytime you see them, it is fundamental they repeat this ritual, so they get accustomed to being your pet. They should repeat, at least 5-10 times:</p>
        <p>"I, &ltname>, am &ltthe name you chose for your pet> and property of &ltyour name>, &ltname you chose for yourself>, and I am grateful."</p>
        <p>Then kiss one of your shoes and start over.</p>
