    <center><h1>Step 6 - Pit Stop II</h1>
        <p>What? Is shoving your foot in their mouth not enough for you? You need to take time to break their will.</p>
        <p>This is another stop for your pet to take a break. Nothing happens at this step, keep having fun with what authority you currently do have: remind them of their place.</p>
        <p>Train them. Make them well used to their mansions. Don't worry, plenty of more steps to come.</p>
